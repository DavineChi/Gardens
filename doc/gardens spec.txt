Garden Simulator ("Gardens")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The garden will be represented visually as a grid with cells where the plants are grown.
User will be asked to choose from three sizes (small, medium, or large).
Plant placement will be random as planting occurs.
 - Future version will allow partitioning for different plants.
When planting, the user will be asked at what density to plant the given seed.
 - This will be based on free garden space and seeds on-hand.
Passage of time, growth, and other as-yet undefined game functions will be turn-based.
There will be an in-game currency.
There will be a market where seeds can be purchased.
Water will be a resource.
Sunlight will be a resource.
Soil nutrients will be a resource.
 - Possibly to provide growth bonuses.
Larger gardens (grid size) must somehow be more challenging.
Yields can be sold at a market for profit.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Do not spend any time making the game look pretty.
Just get it working for now (text-based).
